# Penn Labs Design Challenge

Welcome to the Penn Labs Spring '19 Design Challenge!

## Introduction

We want you to take a look at Penn Course Search, a product acquired by Penn Labs. We are adding it to our Penn Course suite along with Penn Course Review and Penn Course Alert. On Penn Course Search, students can filter and search for courses, view simplified ratings, and create mock schedules. Familiarize yourself with it here: [Penn Course Search](https://penncoursesearch.com/).

Treat this assignment as if you're a designer working with product managers and developers. Your deliverable will have to communicate to them the core functionality, flow, and design of the updated product. 

## **What are we assessing?**

This project will help us understand your design thinking as well as your familiarity with tactical execution, which is crucial for designing products with cross-functional teams. 

1. **Product**: do you understand the end user, their specific use cases, and how the product will address their needs? What existing resources meet the user's needs and what gaps exist? Consider which features make sense to add. Do not add things that seem ‚Äúcool‚Äù but don‚Äôt address key needs you've identified.

2. **Intuition**: is the design focused, simple, and intuitive? Does it complement the existing Penn Labs brand?

3. **Execution**: are the mockups/prototypes thorough, easy to understand, and ready to be passed on to a developer? Note that pixel-perfect design is not a criteria - we want to see how you represent your design thinking in a visual form.

## Context

Let's be real: how painful is making mock schedules on Penn InTouch while toggling between your academic planning worksheet, course listings on multiple departmental websites, and any other planning documents you made yourself?

Registration is a complex process where students have to think about major requirements, course/professor ratings, and course offerings. All this data comes from a variety of different sources and is not leveraged to create any easy-to-use tools. Students would benefit from features such as comprehensive search filtering, integrated ratings, and a sleek mock scheduler.

To this end, Labs recently acquired Penn Course Search (the name is not set in stone). As it currently exists, it offers certain search filters and a mock scheduler that's optimized for 1 semester. We want to clean it up and integrate it into our Penn Course suite, which already includes Penn Course Review and Penn Course Alert.

## Deliverables

Think about all the information students need when they go through the course selection and registration process. (Re)design Penn Course Search to help students do this more efficiently. As a bonus question, think about how to market this product to increase user adoption.

Your deliverables:

- High fidelity mockup or prototype of the Penn Course Search web app
    - This can be presented in whatever way you choose. Mockups can just be images, or compiled on a document with accompanying comments. Pototypes can be on Invision. Or a Github repo. Really, as long as I can clearly view your work, any format is acceptable.
- Bonus: explain what key features you would highlight in a marketing push and how you would do so, for this updated Penn Course Search product. We generally market via Facebook, so you can frame this in that context. Or feel free to think outside the box if you want. See FAQ to find examples.
`   - This is important because as you think about product design, you also have to think about how to best sell these features and make them pertinent to the average Penn student. Our products are nothing without users who can use them to their fullest potential!

In your deliverables, you are **highly encouraged** to provide written aids explaining your design (features, process, etc.) - anything that will help us understand you better as a designer!

Finally, here are a few things we want you to remember when designing: 

- What information and functions are integral (that address specific pain points of Penn students!)
- Ask how the user will *interact* with the application before you consider exactly how it works
- Edge cases regarding data or user behavior, and how to account for them
- This is a complex application, so be wary of getting bogged down in the specifics - ie. instead of looking up and writing out the *exact* College requirements, just put placeholders.
- **Don't get overwhelmed!** We want to see how you approach a design problem, think through its fundamental issues, and represent that in a mockup/prototype. We do not expect a perfect, 100% complete app design!

## *Suggested* tools

Sketch, Adobe Suite, InVision, Figma, HTML/CSS. You're free to use whatever tool you're most comfortable with! 

[Penn Labs style guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1auGLpo7P1IidLidB3erCN-XxDAh75Ko_/view). This gives an overview of the colors and fonts we use at Penn Labs. Also consider what style conventions are currently used in Penn Course suite products.

[Bulma, the CSS framework we use for products.](https://bulma.io/documentation/) Feel free to reference this for the basic CSS components that we use. Do not feel obligated to use follow it exactly, it's just a reference!

## Submission

Congratulations - you've completed the design challenge üéâ

By **8am on Monday 2/11,** email your deliverables to **contact@pennlabs.org** with the subject line: "DESIGN APPLICATION: *YOUR_NAME_HERE".* If your file is big, upload it to Google Drive and just link that in your email. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **I have a clarification question / a lot of other questions / I need help.**

    Come by Office Hours from 1-3pm on Saturday 2/9 @ Steinberg Dietrich 209. We will be there to answer any questions about the challenge and how to approach it.

    Always feel free to reach out by emailing me (Valencia) at vfu@sas.upenn.edu. I will get back to you as soon as possible all weekend :)

- **What do you mean by the bonus question?**

    Peep the Penn Labs Facebook page and you'll see our posts about new products/features. So if you were to create one of these posts for your product, how would you strategically position its features to compel students to adopt it? You can just explain how, produce an actual Facebook post and/or graphic, or both, or even something else - pretty open-ended.

- **What's after this round?**

    This is the last round! You may get an email asking you to clarify your decisions or explain your design, but otherwise you will be updated with final decisions by Friday 2/15.

- **This is so much work for a weekend. What are you really expecting?**

    As mentioned previously, we want to see your approach to design and your mockup/prototyping skills in action. We do not expect an end-to-end 100%-thorough product design!

    We definitely want you to give this challenge your all, but don't want you work for 48 hours nonstop. Hopefully a weekend is ample time to work thoughtfully, and even revisit your design a couple times, before finally submitting.
